Multiclassification learning:
<[1,2,3]> (Class 1 == Answer 1 is right etc.) <word_count_raw_search_for_answer_1>:<word_count> <word_count_raw_for_appended_search_for_answer_1>:<woud_count> <word_count_word_relation_to_question_for_answer_1>:<word_count> <word_count_wikipedia_search>:<word_count> ...same features for every answer ...

Discussion:

This method would account for relative values between answers ie. It would classify the answer as 1,2,3 depending on if answer 3 has higher feature values than answer 1.

Linear regression learning <- Probably choose this one since it makes more sense for a machine learning model
<regression_value>  <word_count_raw_search>:<word_count> <word_count_raw_appended_search>:<woud_count> <word_count_word_relation_to_question>:<word_count> <word_count_wikipedia_search>:<word_count>

Discussion:
This would give an isolated regression value but does not account for relative regression values within its output.
